Rules to follow while developing the project:

## Core Development Principles
1. Code must be scalable, maintainable, modular, and extensible
2. Use Docker for containerization
3. Use docker-compose for orchestration
4. Use Dockerfile for building the image
5. No useless comments, placeholders, or dummy code
6. API calls must be real, make use of database, APIs, etc
7. Follow proper error handling and logging practices
8. Use environment variables for configuration
9. Follow security best practices
10. Use yarn/pnpm for package management

## HiLabs Contract Classifier Specific Requirements
11. Memory optimization for 8GB RAM systems
12. Local AI models only (no external APIs)
13. Self-learning and adaptive capabilities
14. Audit trails for healthcare compliance
15. Human-in-the-loop validation system
16. Performance benchmarking and profiling
17. Dual-mode processing (fast vs accurate)
18. Standard vs Non-Standard classification output

## Architecture Guidelines
19. Backend-centric structure with FastAPI
20. Service-oriented architecture within backend
21. Proper separation of concerns
22. Configuration-driven development
23. Lightweight and memory-efficient components

## Documentation Standards
36. API documentation with examples
37. Architecture documentation
38. Deployment and setup instructions
39. Performance analysis and TAT reports
40. Code comments only where business logic is complex
